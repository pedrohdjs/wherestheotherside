#Whereistheotherside ðŸŒŽ

##A simple website made to tell you where is the exact opposite side of the world relative from where you access it.

###This is a portfilio project, featuring the use of the following technologies:
- PHP: Present in the index.php file and in the API folder, which provides a simple JSON-serving RESTful API suiting the website needs.
- Javascript: Present in the files scripts.js and animations.js in src/js. I have used Bootstrap because of its stylesheets, since style and design were not my biggest concerns in this specific application. This project includes jQuery simply because Bootstrap still requires it by now (30/10/2020), but I tried to avoid using it.
- HTML: Present in the index.hmtl file in the root directory.
- CSS: Present in assets/css, in the files animations.css and custom.css.fadf
